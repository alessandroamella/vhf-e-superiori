  "bornFrom": "Born from an idea by <1>IU4JJJ</1> Pietro Cerrone, a member of the VHF e Superiori chat, who proposed it to <3>IZ5RNF</3> Alessandro Ronca, the group's creator.",
  "workGroup": "The idea was welcomed and a working group was created with the collaboration of <1><0>IC8TEM</0> Costantino Cerrotta</1> (<3>FT8ACTIVITY</3>).",
  "firstEvent": "After outlining the methods and timeline, the group planned the first event, which was promoted on various social platforms as a test of functionality, organization, and management.",
  "inspiration": "Inspired by the very concept of a \"flash mob,\" which aims to bring together as many people as possible for a short time using email and social media—hence the name.",
  "satisfaction": "Many enthusiastic radio amateurs gathered around the first two stations with great satisfaction, and the debut was a success.",
  "activators": "The stations known as \"activating stations\" for the occasion received many contact requests from across Italy.",
  "participants": "The number of participants exceeded expectations, and the management structure passed the test. It was therefore decided to continue with this experience and organize further events.",
  "processDescription": "Through the website \"www.vhfesuperiori.eu\" the eQSL confirming the contact is sent by each activating station. Afterwards, data relating to the participants and the number of contacts — both of the \"hunters\" and the \"activating stations\" — are collected and published, and a score is assigned as follows:",
  "scoring": [
    "Activators receive 2 points for each connection.",
    "Hunters receive 2 points for contacting an Activator and 1 point for all other connections."
  ],

  "intent": "The goal of this event is to encourage the use of VHF 144MHz and UHF 432/1200MHz e Superiori frequencies in voice and CW modes.",
  "stations": "For the occasion, the stations that made themselves available are called \"ACTIVATORS\" and are assigned a suggested frequency, which can be changed at the operator's discretion during the two-hour event. The event will take place on the last Sunday of each month. If the frequency shown in the poster is changed by the operator, they are asked to communicate the new frequency to participants via the chat.",

  "followChat": "Participants in the radio flash mob are invited to FOLLOW THE <1>MESSAGES IN THE vhfesuperiori CHAT</1> so as not to miss stations trying to make contact but unable to. The message request tool in the group chat proves to be an essential contribution to completing the connection.",
  "thankYouForParticipating": "THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING.",

  "chatVhf": "THE VHFESUPERIORI CHAT",
  "founding": "Founded on January 28, 2018 by Alessandro Ronca <1>IZ5RNF</1>, the vhfesuperiori chat aims to be a quickly accessible hub where all radio amateurs active on frequencies from 144 MHz upwards can gather to know in real time who is available on the air at any given moment and which direction to call.",
  "foundingChat": "To create a WhatsApp group, you need at least two people. So, Alessandro Ronca explains his idea to <1>IZ5IOQ</1> Giacomo Matteucci, a longtime friend, asking if he shares the same vision and agrees to start the group with him. With Giacomo's consent, the chat is born.",
  "antennas": "The first advantage offered by the group is the ability to correctly point antennas toward the correspondent, thus avoiding calling in directions where no stations are operating and receiving no replies.",
  "latestYears": "In recent years, there has been a collapse in the use of these bands, to the point where a negative drumbeat had developed, claiming that no operators were left on these frequencies, now considered \"dead.\" Following the original project to form a large group in the first two years, Alessandro invited all the station operators he contacted during his SSB activity on 144MHz and 432MHz to the newly created chat. Some accepted, others declined.",
  "nobodyOnVhf": "The first goal was to break the cycle of repetition: \"There's no one on VHF SSB, let alone higher bands.\" Slowly, the number of friends who agreed to join the group increased from 3 to 5 to 20 to 30 to 50, but many areas of the country remained uncovered. Reaching over 100 members after two years of uninterrupted radio activity, invitations, and onboarding was a memorable result. The chat became useful and more and more messages were exchanged thanks to the contributions of many passionate users.",
  "results": "Proud of the result and the fact that the group was finally being used for its intended purpose, Alessandro continued, as he still does, to invite operators to join vhfesuperiori by contacting potential members one by one. As the number of members approached 200, managing the chat became increasingly time-consuming and demanding.",
  "adminsNominated": "He then decided to appoint administrators to support development, following a logic of territorial coverage, competence, availability, and shared vision. The administrators quickly became essential and served as regional references for new and existing members. The current division remains the same: north, center, central-south, and south. New friends joined and started or resumed their radio activities.",
  "stationsIncreasing": "Over time, there has been an exponential increase in the number of operating stations and connections, both on a daily basis and during events, with a still-growing trend. The enthusiasm and passion for this hobby continue to attract and entertain more and more enthusiasts. As of March 10, 2025, the group has over 700 participants from Italy, Spain, Switzerland, France, Croatia, Malta, Bulgaria, Serbia, and more.",
  "websiteCreation": "This large participation led to the creation of this website, aiming to spread enthusiasm and passion for these bands and modes beyond Italy and throughout Europe. I want to personally and sincerely thank each and every one of you for joining this project and sharing the idea. Every single operator, with their contribution and passion, is bringing more and more radio amateurs back to VHF e Superiori frequencies.",
  "thankYouForContributing": "A HEARTFELT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION, WITHOUT WHICH IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO BRING SO MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER TO ENJOY RADIO TOGETHER.",
